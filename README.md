# Coursework-Java
Checkers


Instructions for the project - Coursework for Java

1. I have created three folders- doc, src and out.
 Src - consists of all needed java source files.
 Out- consists of all classes.
 Doc- the documentation 

2. To run the java program, you need to locate the classpath and execute java swing.scc110cw1.Main from there
 Path ---> C:\Users\tomam\Documents\CW\SCC110-java\toma01\src, 
in this case it will be executed from SCC110-java\toma01\src.
Otherwise it won't run properly giving you an error that everything has been lost or you are not in the right path.

3. Why the classes have been doubled?

The problem I cannot seem to fix this. 
When I compiled at first the program, it has doubled the classes(the classes got multiplied)
So right now I have classes spread among "out" folder and among the ".java" files.
